# Portfolio Website - Final Project (Task 5)
This repository contains my final project for the **Web Development Internship Program**, where I developed a **Portfolio Website** to showcase my skills and projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the integration of advanced front-end development skills, performance optimization techniques, and responsive design.

## üöÄ Project Overview
The **Portfolio Website** includes multiple pages to display personal details, projects, and a contact form. It is fully responsive, optimized for performance, and cross-browser compatible.

### Key Features:
- **Home Page:** Includes an introduction to who I am, my background, and expertise.
- **Projects Page:** Displays a collection of my projects with images, descriptions, and interactive components.
- **Contact Page:** A functional contact form with validation to allow users to reach out to me directly.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
- **Optimized Performance:** Includes techniques like lazy loading for images and file minimization to enhance load times.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensures the website works smoothly across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structured the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS:** Styled the website with a focus on responsiveness and mobile-first design.
- **JavaScript:** Added dynamic behavior, including a contact form with validation and interactive elements.
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented with CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
- **Performance Optimization:** Minimized CSS and JS files, applied lazy loading for images, and reduced HTTP requests.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Ensured compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers.

## üåü Objectives & Achievements
### 1. **Full Web Application**
